TODO for the game: 
1.) Impliment some Y sorting becuase the player overlapping everything is getting kind of irritating!

2.) Have when the player attacks there a little swoosh so its easier to see if the player is attacking.

3.) Draw some player movemnt and direction so hes not facing the same way all the time!

4.) Make some better floor tiles.

5.) refactor some code so it wont be a pain in the ass later to fix!
